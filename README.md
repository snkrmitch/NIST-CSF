# NIST

## Overview

After completing the ISO 27001 foundations course, I began exploring other widely recognized frameworks in GRC that every Information Security and Cybersecurity professional should be familiar with. Thatâ€™s when I discovered the NIST-CSF. As I reviewed various job descriptions, I consistently noticed that NIST-CSF was frequently mentioned as a key requirement. Therefore, I knew that this should be something I study next. 

I decided to go through another fundamentals course, this time on Coursera. 

## Course Structure

This course is split into 10 different modules with a final exam at the end. It begins with going through the basics of Cybersecurity, and progresses into Cybersecurity frameworks component, how to communicate these requirements, risk management, CSF core functions, CSF categories, and overall summary of the framework + some tips before you sit the test.

## Key Takeaways

The main key takeaway I've taken away from this course is how different yet similar NIST is to ISO 27001. The main difference between the two is that NIST is a framework which is voluntary and made to be flexible whereas ISO 27001 is a more format standard, where organisations can show that they are compliant. I think that each have their own benefits, specifically NIST is great in its own way as I think its a much more simplified version of ISO 27001, and a lot easier to understand and communicate to others who might not be as tech savy, for example, stakeholders. In other words, it provides a common language for understanding, mapping, and expressing cybersecurity risks to internal and external stakeholders. 

However, one key thing I've noticed is that all these frameworks share a common theme, they all revolve around the CIA triad. Within NIST, CIA is emphasised through the five core functions - Identifying, Protecting, Detecting, Responding, and Recovering sensitive data which overall guides an organisation towards a more secure and adaptive Cybersecrity position. Whereas, ISO 27001 supports this all through an ISMS, which ensures compliance driven risk management.

For me, NIST seems like it's very tailored towards, however, due to its flexible approach, I can see how it can apply to the rest of the world. I can understand how it would be beneficial to some Kiwi businesses who wish to assess and enhance their cybersecurity posture without pursuing formal compliance. However, if I were to decide on which framework to pursue, I think that ISO 27001 provides more value both internally and externally. Even if organisations don't require formal compliance, I think creating and implementing an ISMS provides a much higher level overview of their current security posture and highlights best practices to further strengthen their security framework.
