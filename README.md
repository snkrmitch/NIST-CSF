# NIST

## Overview

After completing the ISO 27001 foundations course, I began exploring other widely recognized frameworks in GRC that every Information Security and Cybersecurity professional should be familiar with. Thatâ€™s when I discovered the NIST-CSF. As I reviewed various job descriptions, I consistently noticed that NIST-CSF was frequently mentioned as a key requirement. Therefore, I knew that this should be something I study next. 

I decided to go through another fundamentals course, this time on Coursera. 

## Course Structure

This course is split into 10 different modules with a final exam at the end. It begins with going through the basics of Cybersecurity, and progresses into Cybersecurity frameworks component, how to communicate these requirements, risk management, CSF core functions, CSF categories, and overall summary of the framework + some tips before you sit the test.
